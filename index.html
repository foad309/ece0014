                    A very notable approach in the research phase potentially breaks the
                    structural limits of conventional processing architectures. It is called configurable computing
                    . Here the program code causes the compiler to create intermediate code suitable for 
                    runtime reconfigurable field-programmable gate arrays in which during the scope of program 
                    objects the configurable logic represents the calculating structure able to perform as desired.
                    Since many objects can potentially perform in parallel on streaming data this ultimatively constitutes 
                    an advanced parallel processing architecture. Configurable computing could be categorized under computing 
                    in memory which is inspired by the function of the neuronal brain, where the processor and the memory eventually
                    cannot be distinguished from each other.</dd>
